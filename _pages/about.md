I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. ZHANG Qingfu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhan7/index.html). 

Before joining in CityUHK, I received my B.Eng and M.Eng degrees from School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, in 2020 and 2023, respectively. With the supervision of [Prof. LIU Jing](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/LJ22/zh_CN/index/339621/list/), I have spent delightful seven years in Xi'an and Guangzhou.

My current research interests can be summarized as "Few for Many", mainly including the following two aspects:
1. **Social Network Analysis**: Finding few social members to serve many others.
2. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Finding few solutions to optimize many objectives.

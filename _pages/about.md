I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), [City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. ZHANG Qingfu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhan7/index.html). 

Before joining in CityUHK, I received my B.Eng and M.Eng degrees from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), in 2020 and 2023, respectively. With the supervision of [Prof. LIU Jing](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/LJ22/zh_CN/index/339621/list/), I have spent delightful seven years in Xi'an and Guangzhou.

My current research interests can be summarized as "Few for Many", mainly including the following two aspects:
1. **Social Network Analysis**: Finding a small number of social members to serve many others.
2. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Finding a small number of solutions to serve many objectives.
